# EcoScan - Plant Disease Detection & Carbon Footprint Calculator

EcoScan is a web-based platform that helps users identify plant diseases through image analysis and calculate their carbon footprint based on lifestyle factors. This project combines environmental awareness with AI-driven insights.

## Features

### ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Detection
- Upload plant images to detect diseases using an AI-based model.
- Get instant results with the disease name and suggested remedies.
- User-friendly interface with drag-and-drop image uploading.

### ðŸŒŽ Carbon Footprint Calculator
- Input transportation, energy, food, and consumption data.
- Get an estimate of your annual COâ‚‚ emissions.
- Compare your footprint with the global average and get personalized reduction tips.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **API for Plant Detection**: Integrated with `https://susya.onrender.com`
- **Data Processing**: JavaScript-based calculations for carbon footprint estimation

## API Integration
For plant disease detection, the project interacts with an API:
```js
fetch("https://susya.onrender.com", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ image: uploadedBase64 })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
    console.log(data); // Display detected plant disease info
})
.catch(error => console.error("Error analyzing image:", error));
```
